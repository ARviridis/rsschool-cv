#### ABOUT ME:
If you're reading this, you probably want to know more about me. In that case, here's my story: 

My path to programming began at the University, namely with the direction **_Computer science and computer facilities_**. Education was quite productive and interesting, and most importantly, it gave me a technical base for further development. 

By the beginning of the 4th year, I managed to find the direction that was most attractive to me - **_Frontend development_**. At first, I tried to develop in this area on my own, although this path was not the easiest. After a couple of months and three successful interviews, I was able to enroll in a *JavaScript Development* course at **_Epam_**. The basics of frontend and Js development were obtained there! I have a bachelor degree, graduated with honors. For now I‚Äôm studying the master‚Äôs program and taking courses at **_RS School_**.
I would like to try myself in real, combat projects and get the appropriate experience for further work.
